language: English
summary: 'When you travel, everything changes: people, languages, time zones, and
  even units. It may be difficult to read the temperature in Fahrenheit when you’ve
  always used Celsius, or to measure yourself in kilos if you’ve only used pounds.
  It’s no easy matter, though a nice unit converter could certainly help! In this
  project, you will write a converter that handles distance, weight, and temperature
  units – all the traveller’s essentials.<br/><br/>Learn more at <a href="https://hyperskill.org">https://hyperskill.org/projects/70</a>'
