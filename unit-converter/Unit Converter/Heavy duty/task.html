<h2 style="text-align: center;">Description</h2>

<p>At this stage, you will write a program that can convert weight from one common unit to another. The user should also be able to convert values from <em>any</em> of the following units of weight to <em>any other</em>.</p>

<p>Hint: Hard-coding all the possible conversion ratios is possible, but not very efficient. A smarter way would be to convert the input value to one intermediate ‘hub’ unit (for example, meters) using the general conversion table below, and then convert that intermediate value to the end target value.</p>

<p>The conversion should follow these rules:</p>

<ol>
	<li>One gram equals 1 gram.</li>
	<li>One kilogram equals 1000 grams.</li>
	<li>One milligram equals 0.001 grams.</li>
	<li>One pound equals 453.592 grams.</li>
	<li>One ounce equals 28.3495 grams.</li>
</ol>

<p>The user should input a number, then the source unit of weight, then some random word (for example, "in" or "to", but it can be any other word), and finally the target unit of mass. In addition to the units above, the following units should also be allowed:</p>

<ol>
	<li>For grams, the user can input "g", "gram", or "grams".</li>
	<li>For kilograms, the user can input "kg", "kilogram", or "kilograms".</li>
	<li>For milligrams, the user can input "mg", "milligram", or "milligrams".</li>
	<li>For pounds, the user can input "lb", "pound", or "pounds".</li>
	<li>For ounces, the user can input "oz", "ounce", or "ounces".</li>
</ol>

<p>The program should keep processing user input until they enter “exit”.</p>
