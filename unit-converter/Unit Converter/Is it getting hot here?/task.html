<h2 style="text-align: center;">Description</h2>

<p>Let's rewrite our program using enums. The problem with representing measurement units as strings is that strings may take longer to process, especially since each unit has at least three different accepted string notations (such as “m”, “meter”, and “meters”).</p>

<p>If you represent each unit by a special enum value, your code becomes cleaner and more readable. Since comparing enum values is much faster than comparing strings, your code is also processed faster.</p>

<p>The main units of temperature used today are degrees Celsius (<span class="math-tex">\( C \)</span>), degrees Fahrenheit (<span class="math-tex">\( F \)</span>), and kelvins (<span class="math-tex">\( K \)</span>).</p>

<p>Converting these units is somewhat different from dealing with length or weight. 0 kelvin is not equal to 0 degrees Celsius nor 0 degrees Fahrenheit, and neither is 0 degrees Celsius equal to 0 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>

<p>Below are all the formulas for converting one unit of temperature to another.<strong> </strong>In these, the letter</p>

<p><span class="math-tex">\( K \)</span> stands for kelvin,</p>

<p><span class="math-tex">\( C \)</span> stands for degrees Celsius and</p>

<p><span class="math-tex">\( F \)</span> means degrees Fahrenheit.</p>

<p>To convert Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa, use the following formulas:</p>

<p><span class="math-tex">\( C = (F - 32) * 5 / 9 \)</span></p>

<p><span class="math-tex">\( F = C * 9 / 5 + 32 \)</span></p>

<p>To convert kelvins to Celsius or vice versa, use these formulas:</p>

<p><span class="math-tex">\( K = C + 273.15 \)</span></p>

<p><span class="math-tex">\( C = K - 273.15 \)</span></p>

<p>To convert between degrees Fahrenheit and kelvins, use these formulas:</p>

<p><span class="math-tex">\( F = K * 9 / 5 - 459.67 \)</span></p>

<p><span class="math-tex">\( K = (F + 459.67) * 5 / 9 \)</span></p>

<p>The program should allow the following notations:</p>

<ol>
	<li>For degrees Celsius, the user can input "degree Celsius", "degrees Celsius", "celsius" "dc", or "c".</li>
	<li>For degrees Fahrenheit, the user can input "degree Fahrenheit", "degrees Fahrenheit", "fahrenheit", "df", or "f".</li>
	<li>For kelvins, the user can input "kelvin", "kelvins", or "k".
	<p> </p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>At this stage, if the user attempts to perform an impossible conversion, such as meters to kilograms, or if one of the input units is not recognized, the program should output an appropriate error message.</p>

<p>If you cannot determine the unit, output "???" instead (obviously, it would be inside an error message). Don't forget that in the error message, both measurement types should be written in the plural, not singular.</p>

<p>If the user wants to convert <strong>weight</strong> from one to another but inputs a negative amount, you should print <code class="java">Weight shouldn't be negative</code>. The same is true for <strong>length</strong>, and the message should be <code class="java">Length shouldn't be negative</code>.</p>

<p>What to do if a query is bad? Handle this! Try to parse the following parts:</p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">&lt;number&gt; +
&lt;(unit name) or (degree + unit name) or (degrees + unit name)&gt; +
&lt;random word like "to" or "in"&gt; +
&lt;(unit name) or (degree + unit name) or (degrees + unit name)&gt;</code></pre>

<p>If there is an error, output <code class="java">Parse error</code>.</p>
