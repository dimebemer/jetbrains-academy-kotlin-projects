  <p>You want to create a game and you decided to keep the playing field in some structure. You want to have a single field for the game, so you decided to store it in a <code class="language-kotlin">PlayingField</code> object. In addition, you added a <code class="language-kotlin">Size</code> object inside that class to store the field measurements. This is a 2D game, so <code class="language-kotlin">width</code> and <code class="language-kotlin">height</code> properties will be enough to define the field size. But your field can change, so you need to be able to resize it using the <code class="language-kotlin">changeSize()</code> function with the following signature: </p> 
  <pre><code class="language-kotlin">fun changeSize(width: Int, height: Int)</code></pre> 
  <p>The playing field size cannot be negative. If that happens, set the value to 0.</p> 
  <p>Note that the <code class="language-kotlin">changeSize()</code> function must be a member of the <code class="language-kotlin">Size</code> object.</p>
