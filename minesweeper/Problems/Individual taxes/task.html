  <p>In some country there are N companies. The law of this country says that the taxes of each company are individual and appointed by a president. President wants to know which company pays the highest taxes. However, none of the president's proxies know math well enough, so they asked for your help. Can you solve this problem?<br> <br> The first line of the input contains N, that is, the number of companies in this country.<br> The second line contains the yearly incomes of each company. All the numbers are non-negative integers.<br> The third line contains individual taxes for each company, that is, the percentage of the company's income. All the numbers are integers from 0 to 100 inclusive.<br> <br> Output the number of the company that pays the most taxes. Keep in mind that the enumeration of the companies starts from number 1. If there are several companies with the same payment sizes, output the number of the company with the lower number.</p>
